		<p class="first">I am a UX/UI designer <strong>born and raised in Madrid, Spain</strong> to an American mother and a Palestinian father. I am a world traveler with a background in biology, photography and education.</p>

		<p>I have done volunteer work in places such as South Africa, China, Vietnam, Greece, France and Belize and have <strong>visited over 30 countries</strong>  including Ecuador, Cuba, Italy, Austria, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and the Seychelles islands. I’m so grateful to have traveled so much as it has given me the <strong>opportunity to learn about different cultures</strong>  and that has allowed me to connect with all sorts of people and <strong>understand their needs</strong> .</p>

		<p>I’ve always been drawn to <strong>solving problems</strong>  and after studying <strong>Biology</strong>  in college, I worked as an <strong>IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) lab technician</strong>  where I realised I wasn’t meant to be sitting in dim light looking through a microscope and following very <strong>strict research protocols</strong> . I needed more creativity, more light and more adventure. I decided to do a <strong>MS in Biological Photography and Imaging</strong>  to learn how to best <strong>support scientific research with photography and video</strong>  while learning different techniques. During the Masters, I learned design tools such as Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop and <strong>fell in love with digital design</strong>  but didn’t really know what to do with this new interest.</p>

		<p>Education has always been a field that has interested me and after the Masters I spent some months working as an <strong>ESL teacher in Spain</strong> . One of my biggest frustrations during this time was being able to teach a small group of people or a person at a time. I wanted to <strong>educate many people at the same time</strong> . During this period of time I found out about <strong>UX design</strong>  and realised it was the <strong>perfect fit</strong>  for me where I could <strong>research what people need and solve their problems creatively with a greater impact</strong> .</p>
		
		<p>Having experienced so many fields in such a short period of  time has given me the <strong>ability to learn fast</strong> . This is the reason why I love the tech industry; it is fast-paced, and there is always something new to learn.</p>

		<p><strong>UX is the combination of all my passions</strong> : problem-solving, research, design, creativity and learning about people. Coming from a <strong>multicultural</strong>  and <strong>diverse background</strong> , and having had so many <strong>amazing experiences throughout my life</strong> , gives me the opportunity and ability to think about <strong>problem-solving with a unique perspective</strong> .</p>
