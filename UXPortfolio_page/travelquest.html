		<h4>DISCOVER</h4>
		<h5>WHAT IS GEOCACHING?</h5>
			<p class="first">Location based real life treasure hunt. User goes on the website or mobile App, gets the GPS coordinates of the desired cache, and goes on to find the cache. Once the user arrives, he/she logs virtually, manually or both. The user is able to accumulate logs.</p>

		<h5>EMPATHY MAP</h5>
			<p>We created a presumed persona in order to develop an empathy map. This persona is a young traveler who likes to travel on her own. The purpose of this empathy map was to continue our research to discover more about people who like to travel.</p>
		<img src="" alt="Empathy1">
		<img src="" alt="Empathy2">

		<h5>SURVEY (65 RESPONSES)</h5>
			<p>To get answers to our questions about travellers we developed a survey. The main goal of the survey was to find out how people travel (alone, with children, etc.), if they use travel guides and why do the use them.</p>

			<p>Here are they key insights:</p>
			<img src="" alt="graph1">
			<img src="" alt="graph2">
		
			<p>Main reasons why people use travel guides:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Activity Recommendations.</li>
					<li>Food and Drink.</li>
					<li>Historical Information.</li>
					<li>Itinerary Recommendations.</li>
				</ol>
		<h5>CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY</h5>
			<p>We went Geocaching using the App "Geocaching" to understand what it was all about:</p>
			<img src="" alt="Contextual1">

		<h5>INTERVIEWS</h5>
			<p>We interviewed 7 different people to see how they felt about Geocaching. We got different opinions such as:</p>
			<p>“I always use the compass feature on my phone to find north before I start trying to walk somewhere.”</p>
			<p>“People ask if this is where they can find the geocache all the time, but it’s not in here. I hope they find it.”
			</p>
			<p>“My favourite part is the hunting part, following the GPS, and looking around carefully like a detective looking for clues.”</p>
		<h5>AFFINITY MAP</h5>
			<p>After interviewing people and doing contextual enquiry we wrote down in post-its what we have heard and experienced about geocaching. We created an affinity map to identify the different patterns.</p>
			<img src="" alt="Contextual1">

			<p>Key Insights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Disruptive to businesses.</li>
				<li>Navigation is confusing.</li>
				<li>Disappointing experience.</li>
				<li>Activity for travellers.</li>
				<li> Good feedback along the way.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Conclusion: The hook for geocaching is the searching to find something. For our design solution, we can include elements of geocaching and leave some behind.</p>

		<h4>DEFINE</h4>
		<h5>RAND MCNALLY'S PROBLEM</h5>
			<p class="first">Increase digital product presence while making the most of their existing data.</p>

		<h5>USER'S PROBLEM</h5>
			<p>Wants an easy, and fun way to discover, and explore a travel destination.</p>
		<h5>SOLUTION</h5>
			<p>A travel app that creates an itinerary in quest format, which utilises Rand McNally’s wealth of data.</p>
		<h5>REDIFINE PERSONA</h5>
			<img src="" alt="persona">
		<h5>USER JOURNEY MAP</h5>
			<p>After defining our main persona we did a user journey map to see the opportunities of features to include in the App:</p>
			<img src="" alt="UserJourney">

		<h4>DESIGN</h4>
		<h5>COMPARATIVE RESEARCH</h5>
			<p class="first">We did comparative analysis to get some ideas for what the design would look like. We incorporated features from these 3 Apps (Spyglass, Tinder and Two dots).</p>
			<img src="" alt="SkyGlass">
			<img src="" alt="Tinder">
			<img src="" alt="Two dots">
		<h5>SCENARIOS</h5>
			<p>We also considered the scenarios in which Edwina and Edgar could find themselves in to have a better understanding of the possible uses for the App.</p>
			<img src="" alt="Scenarios">
				<ol>
					<li>Edwina has arrived to SF with her boyfriend Edgar and they want to explore the city together.</li>
					<li>Edwina captures memories while she is exploring San Francisco.</li>
					<li>Edwina wants to relive her journey of San Francisco when she is back in Australia.</li>
				</ol>
		<h5>SKETCHES</h5>
			<p>After we finished doing comparative research, setting the different possible scenarios and taking into consideration the opportunities of the user journey map, we did a couple of rounds of design studio and completed the first sketches.</p>
			<img src="" alt="Sketches">
		<h5>WIREFRAMES & VISUAL DESIGN</h5>
			<p>We used Sketch to digitalise the wireframes that we had previously designed. We took some design decisions based on the User Research previously done. Here are our most important interaction screens.</p>
			<img src="" alt="VisualDesign">
		<h5>STYLE GUIDE</h5>
			<img src="" alt="StyleGuide">
		<h5>USER TESTING</h5>
			<p>After having the first prototype ready we did some user testing with 6 different people to get an idea of wether or not the App was intuitive and easy to use. Some of the feedback we got was:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Include progressive feedback every time an action is done.</li>
				<li>Show where you are in the map.</li>
				<li>Confusing.</li>
				<li>Users had problems using Hours/Places/Days.</li>
				<li>Have the option of “save for later” referring to the destinations.</li>
				<li>Get some kind of rewards along the way- gamifying the experience.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h4>DELIVER</h4>
		<h5>FINAL PROTOTYPE</h5>
			<p class="first">For our final Prototype we used Invision to show how the App works.
			Task: Edwina visits San Francisco and wants to create a quest based on her interests.</p>
			<div class= "button"><a href="">TRAVEL QUEST PROTOTYPE</a></div>
		<h5>NEXT STEPS</h5>
			<p>We thought about the next steps in order to make Travel Quest a better experience for the different users.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create another persona (family).</li>
					<li>Incorporate augmented reality in the App.</li>
					<li>Translate to different languages.</li>
					<li>Have the option of sharing data through bumping the phone.</li>
					<li>Add different rewards along the way so the user feels more engaged.</li>
					<li>Being able to share the experience in social media.</li>
					<li>Iterating previous designs.</li>
				</ol>
		<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
			<p>The challenge of this project was that the brief was very broad and we had no restrictions for the solution. Having so many options give us the opportunity to explore different solutions through creativity. Our group went from not knowing what geocaching was to creating a design solution for travellers which included elements of geocaching.</p>
